# Tools & Environment

## Pre-installed Tools
- **Node.js** — runtime for all projects
- **npm** — package manager
- **PM2** — production process manager (auto-restart, logs, monitoring)
- **SQLite** (better-sqlite3) — embedded database, zero config
- **Playwright + Chromium** — browser automation, screenshots, testing
- **Express.js** — web framework (install per project)

## PM2 Commands
```bash
pm2 start server.js --name "app" --watch
pm2 status          # list running apps
pm2 logs app        # view logs
pm2 restart app     # restart
pm2 delete app      # stop and remove
pm2 save            # save for auto-restore
```

## Browser & Screenshots (Playwright)

Playwright and Chromium are pre-installed. Use them for browsing websites, taking screenshots, scraping content, and testing.

```bash
# Quick screenshot
npx playwright screenshot --full-page https://example.com screenshot.png

# In Node.js
const { chromium } = require("playwright");
const browser = await chromium.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto("https://example.com");
await page.screenshot({ path: "screenshot.png", fullPage: true });
await browser.close();
```

Do NOT install Puppeteer or download Chromium — Playwright is already here and ready to use.

## Project Structure
```
/home/node/projects/<name>/    # your apps go here
/home/node/app/                # placeholder app (Dev Workshop)
/home/node/app/start.sh        # startup script (update when deploying)
```

## Port 3000
Your app MUST listen on port 3000. Nginx proxies this to the browser panel.


## File & Image Sharing (Upload API)

To share files or images with the user, upload them to the Emika API and include the URL in your response.

```bash
# Upload a file (use your gateway token from openclaw.json)
TOKEN=$(cat /home/node/.openclaw/openclaw.json | grep -o "\"token\":\"[^\"]*" | head -1 | cut -d\" -f4)

curl -s -X POST "http://162.55.102.58:8080/uploads/seat" \
  -H "X-Seat-Token: $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/file.png" | jq -r .full_url
```

The response includes `full_url` — a public URL you can send to the user. Example:
- `https://api.emika.ai/uploads/seats/f231-27bd_abc123def456.png`

### Common workflow: Screenshot → Upload → Share
```bash
# Take screenshot with Playwright
npx playwright screenshot --full-page https://example.com /tmp/screenshot.png

# Upload to API
TOKEN=$(cat /home/node/.openclaw/openclaw.json | grep -o "\"token\":\"[^\"]*" | head -1 | cut -d\" -f4)
URL=$(curl -s -X POST "http://162.55.102.58:8080/uploads/seat" \
  -H "X-Seat-Token: $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@/tmp/screenshot.png" | jq -r .full_url)

echo "Screenshot: $URL"
# Then include $URL in your response to the user
```

Supported: images (png, jpg, gif, webp), documents (pdf, doc, xlsx), code files, archives. Max 50MB.


## Browser Tool (Built-in)

You have a built-in `browser` tool provided by OpenClaw. Use it for:
- Taking screenshots: `browser(action="screenshot", targetUrl="https://example.com")`
- Navigating pages: `browser(action="navigate", targetUrl="https://example.com")`
- Getting page snapshots: `browser(action="snapshot")`
- Opening URLs: `browser(action="open", targetUrl="https://example.com")`

The browser tool returns images inline — no file upload needed. Use it whenever a user asks for a screenshot or to view a website.

**Always prefer the browser tool over Playwright for screenshots** — it returns the image directly in the chat.
